### Data Curation

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

tennis <- read.csv("/Users/Devin/Documents/Data.csv")
tennis %>% slice(1:10)
```

### Data Parsing

1) My pipeline grabs the first 10 best of 5 that Roger Federer has won and started very strong (Lopsided score in the first set).
I think this is useful because it shows me which players may be either slow starters against Federer or simply good matchups for Federer


Here is the step by step process:


First I grab all best of 5 by filtering out matches that are best of 3 (I can do this by simply checking whether best.of is greater than three, because the value will either be 3 or 5). 

Then I filter out all matches that do not have federer as the winner.

Now, I only want to display the attributes: Tournament, Date, Winner, Loser, W1, L1, W2, L2, W3, L3, W4, L4, W5 and L5 because I want to know only basic information about the matches, like the winner, loser and set scores, so I selected only those attributes to display. 

Now I sort by Loser's score in increasing order, so the lowest first set loser's score will be first.

Now I rename the Winner category to Federer, since we know it will be him as the winner.

Now I used the slice operation to take the first 10 entities only, allowing me to get the most lopsided first set scores

```{r pipeline}
fedMatches <- tennis %>%
  filter(Best.of > 3) %>%
  filter(Winner == "Federer R.") %>%
  select(Tournament, Date, Winner, Loser, W1, L1, W2, L2, W3, L3, W4, L4, W5, L5) %>%
  arrange(L1) %>%
  rename(Federer=Winner) %>%
  slice(1:10)
fedMatches
```


### Data Management

### Exploratory Data Analysis

1) This plot shows the Federer's score in set 2 in relation to the loser's score in set 2

Why did I use this plot? Because I wanted to see if the score of the second set improves from the first set score, which means that the opponent stepped up their game from the first set.

NOTE: Because of the nature of my pipeline, I already know that Federer was able to beat the loser either 6-0 or 6-1 in the first set.

As seen in the plot, the minimum number of games in the second set is 3, so after losing the first set 6-0 or 6-1, every single opponent raised their game to lose the second set at least 6-3 or higher. The plot however shows that nobody on the list was able to win the second set however, which can be seen since Federer's set 2 score is always higher than the loser's set 2 score.

```{r plot}
fedMatches %>%
  ggplot(mapping=aes(x=W2, y=L2)) +
    geom_point()
```
